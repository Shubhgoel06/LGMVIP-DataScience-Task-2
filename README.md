# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains a deep learning model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict future stock prices using historical stock market data.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of historical stock market data, including the date and closing prices of a particular stock.

# Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

# Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of multiple layers of LSTM cells followed by a Dense layer for regression. The model is trained to learn temporal patterns from historical stock prices to predict future prices.

# Evaluation
The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for both training and testing data. Lower RMSE values indicate better predictions.

# Future Predictions
The LSTM model is used to make future stock price predictions for a specified number of days. The predictions are plotted alongside the historical data for visualization.

Feel free to explore the code and datasets to understand the LSTM-based stock price prediction process. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out!!
